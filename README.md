# Portfolio-Assignment
The given assignment for class this week was to build a functional portfolio in which we have a navbar, content to describe the portfolio, and certain images. When starting my portfolio I began by creating an index.html and style.css to begin my work. I started off by creating my navbar and making sure the content within the navigation is inside of a row and seperate columns. I continued to apply the button tag to each of the contents within the nav bar. After that I added in my background image, in which I have my name, and then a picture of myself. After that I started to create the main content of my portfolio in which I added information to each of the sections, such as "home, about, contact, and work". The final part of index.html contains the footer.

Moving onto the CSS for this assignment. I made the CSS from scratch while making sure it syncs with the index.html. Within the CSS I designed each section to have the same margin-top, padding-bottom, background-color, color, and font-size. The sections I am talking about are the 4 main categories within my portfolio. In the CSS I adjusted many more features for the text to be in the color of white, follow a certain font, and alignment. The CSS was the least challenging part of this assignment for me. I believe the index.html to be challenging at certain points, especially where there were errrors between the css and index.

After completing the core part of the assignment, two of my friends reviewed my work and believed that I met the requiremenents being asked for this portfolio assignment. Without tthe help of my friends, peers, and TA'S I dont think I could have made it through completing this assignment. Everyone helped me understand the concept and what exactly is being expected out of this assignment.
