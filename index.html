      <p>
        Within this webpage, I will be describing a little bit about myself, my contact information, 
        and work experience in relation to coding and non coding fields. This webpage is a basic overview of my Portfolio,
        covering the basics of myself and certain accomplishments I have achieved throughout time.

      <h3>ABOUT:</h3> 
      <p>
        Who am I and why might I stick out when being compared to other junior developers seeking a full time
        job in coding, you may ask? Well I am very versatile, I have majored in Criminal Justice in college with a 
        minor in Public Administration, currently volunteering with the Edison Police Auxiliary Department, and now
        pursuing a degree in Full Stack Development. I have always dreamed of working in law enforcement as a coder but 
        wanted to learn everything there was aboout the criminal justice field from college. Now I have become very open
        minded to jobs that I would enjoy and a few of them would be in the coding field, for many technology related companies. 
        I enjoy taking certain challenges and expanding my knowledge to learn as much as possible, while still being effective in 
        what I do and what is expected of me to do.
